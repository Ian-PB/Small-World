/**
 * @brief Initializes a GameObject with default values and assigns a name.
 *
 * This function sets up a new GameObject with the specified properties, such as
 * position, velocity, state, color, collider, texture (keyframes), and health.
 *
 * @param obj The GameObject to be initialized.
 * @param name The name to assign to the GameObject.
 * @param position The initial position of the GameObject (in world coordinates).
 * @param velocity The initial velocity of the GameObject, which determines its movement.
 * @param currentState The initial state of the GameObject (e.g., IDLE, RUNNING).
 * @param color The color used to render the GameObject (e.g., for drawing circles or other shapes).
 * @param collider The collider for the GameObject, used for collision detection (e.g., circular collider).
 * @param bounds The bounding box of the GameObject, used for spatial checks.
 * @param keyframes The texture (sprite sheet) to be used for the GameObject's animations.
 * @param health The initial health value of the GameObject
 *
 * This function sets up all the necessary properties for a GameObject, including
 * its name, position, velocity, current state, health, and other attributes needed
 * for gameplay, such as texture (keyframes), collider, and bounding box.
