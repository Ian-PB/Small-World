/**
 * CreateMediator - Creates and initializes a new mediator instance.
 *
 * @obj: The GameObject that the mediator will control and communicate with.
 *
 * This function allocates memory for a new Mediator object and associates it
 * with the provided GameObject. The Mediator serves as an intermediary, enabling
 * communication between the GameObject and external commands, while keeping
 * the GameObject decoupled from direct command handling. The mediator facilitates
 * the triggering of events and actions, such as movement, attacks, or state changes,
 * through its interaction with the GameObject's Finite State Machine (FSM).
 *
 * The Mediator Pattern is used here to centralize communication and control
 * between game objects, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code.
 *
 * For a good explanation on the Mediator Pattern, see:
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mediator-design-pattern/
 *
 * Return: A pointer to the newly created Mediator instance, or NULL if memory
 *         allocation fails.

 *
 * This function processes the provided command, which corresponds to an action or state change.
 * It triggers the appropriate event on the GameObject associated with the mediator, effectively interacting
 * with the GameObject's Finite State Machine (FSM). The FSM processes these events (e.g., MOVE, ATTACK, DIE, etc.)
 * and transitions the GameObject between states or executes actions based on the current state.
 *
 * Commands like movement, firing, and collisions are mapped to specific events, and the FSM determines how
 * the GameObject responds to those events, including transitioning to different states or performing specific actions.
